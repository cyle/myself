## Projects I'm particularly proud of, and why:

I'm pretty happy about the positive feedback I've gotten from [my learning series](projects/learning_series.md), so much so that it's compelled me to write a [whole course about it](projects/webdev_course.md), which is exciting.

When it comes to "work" work, like what I do at work, I'm very proud of [Median](projects/median.md) and [the Star Wars cluster](projects/starwars_cluster.md). I really want to do projects like [the New Media server](projects/newmedia_server.md) and [the IT online revamp](projects/it_dot_emerson.md) more often.

The [lunch tool](projects/lunch_tool.md) and the [dungeon generator](projects/dungeon_generator.md) are just about the nerdiest things in the world. Maybe not as hipster hacker as [FUCK READER](projects/fuckreader.md) or [BROWSER RADIO](projects/browser_radio.md).

I really love having [mfisn](projects/mfisn.md) on my list of projects, as well as the great experiences of [Sexually Frank](projects/sexually_frank.md) and [Vibes](projects/vibes.md).

My writing is very important to me, so I'm especially proud of my [fuck advocacy blog](projects/fuck_advocacy.md) and [the book that's coming out of it](projects/social_disobedience.md).
