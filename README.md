# Myself

This repository is a project to chronicle myself. Really, to chronicle my work. I'm not entirely sure yet why I'm making it a Git repository, other than that I like the additional data version control provides, and I'm used to dealing with them since I'm a developer. This may replace my [personal website](http://cylegage.com/), I'm not sure.

## What's Here

- My [resume](RESUME.md)
- My [skills](SKILLS.md)
- My [current projects](CURRENT_PROJECTS.md)
- My [favorite projects](FAVORITE_PROJECTS.md)
- and all of my [projects](projects/) that I can think of
	
## Learning More

Again, right now I'm not really sure what I'm doing here besides documenting things more publicly. If you have any questions about any of my projects, email me at cylegage@gmail.com.
