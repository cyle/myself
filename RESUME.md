# Employment

**Systems Developer / Architect**
*June 2011 – Present*

As systems developer and architect, my primary role is to build web apps, implement large systems, integrate existing systems so they can talk to each other, and generally just be a code wizard. As architect, I'm usually in charge of how best to construct complex systems for our IT infrastructure. The [list of projects](projects/) contained here explain pretty well what that means, because I've never been sure quite how to explain it.
