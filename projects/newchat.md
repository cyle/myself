# Newchat

**Winter 2011**

## Project Description

I wanted to make a web-based chatroom with node.js using socket.io that could replace IRC, and even allow things like HTML to be used in the chat messages. I succeeded, but I haven't expanded much further. I made a few skins for the chatroom, including one called "Novel view" which makes the chatroom look like a page in a book, including quotation marks and random verbs/adverbs, so chatlines look like this:

"Oh hello there," Cyle said seductively.
