# What's the hold up?

**February 2013**

## Project Description

Keeping with the theme of me building productivity web apps for myself, I created a very simple page that simply lists current high-level projects and their current status. Using jQuery, it allows the user to prioritize, edit, and mark as "done" any of the projects. The impetuous behind it is simply that I needed a place I could quickly keep track of what's holding up certain projects.
