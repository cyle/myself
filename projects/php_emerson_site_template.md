# PHP Basic Site Template - Emerson Edition

**July 2013**

## Project Description

This is basically the same as the [PHP Basic Site Template](php_site_template.md), except it's Emerson-skinned using my custom-built Responsive Design for Emerson (which I wish I could share publicly, but I can't).

## My Role in the Project

I built it, I use it.

## Technology Used

- PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, etc...

## Link to Source Code and/or the Project Itself

Can't share the code, unfortunately. But several of my Emerson projects on here utilize it.
