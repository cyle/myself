# I Can Has Rezearch Papar

**Spring 2008**

## Project Description

For a class on digital studies I wrote my final essay, in HTML to be presented as a webpage instead of a printed-out essay, about the growing subculture of online memes. I focused primarily on sites like 4chan and YTMND. The paper has been cited in various forms around the internet, and I like to think that I wrote about the subject right before the internet actually exploded in popularity culture-wise. I continue to write more about these subjects, albeit much more critically, on my [fuck advocacy blog](http://fuckadvocacy.com/).
