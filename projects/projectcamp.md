# Project Camp Base Tracking Thing

**Summer 2011**

## Project Description

I built a [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/) -esque project management system for myself to keep track of the growing list of things I worked on every day and needed documenting and planning. It was never fully finished, but it helped me document and expand my project list. It featured basic project listing, prioritizing, note-taking, event planning, status tracking, and to do list management on a per-project level.

Eventually, the Emerson IT department just switched to using Basecamp, so I didn't need to develop the project further. I haven't open sourced the code yet, but I probably will soon.
