# SAML Everywhere

**Summer 2012 - Present, ongoing**

## Project Description

Emerson College has no single sign on system. In an effort to create one, I built a custom one for sites that I developed. The Web Services department had their own, as well, and our information system had its own. In an effort to begin consolidating them, I've begun rolling out the SAML standard, using [SimpleSAMLphp](http://simplesamlphp.org/), across campus. This project involves rewriting a lot of old apps, and integrating SAML into new apps.

## My Role in the Project

Project lead, implementer, maintainer.
