# mfisn v3.0

**Spring 2012**

## Project Description

mfisn (motherfucker, i said no) is one of my favorite sites on the internet, and has been for a very long time. It's a curated link-pasting community, as old as 4chan. In 2010 I was allowed to be a moderator with the hope that I could create a new version of the site, as 2.0 was old and some features were being requested that the owner didn't have time for. I dragged my feet for awhile, but a few site failures brought it up as a necessary issue. I rebuilt the site from scratch, but kept the old look and feel of the site.

## My Role in the Project
