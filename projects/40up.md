# 40-Up Tackle Company

**Winter 2008 - Present, Ongoing**

## Project Description

My grandfather used to own and run the US Line Company and the 40-Up Tackle Company. US Line made lead-core fishing line, and many other things, while 40-Up made and still makes tip-up ice fishing tackle. The US Line half was sold and shut down several years ago, but the 40-Up side lives on. My grandfather asked me to make a website for his catalog, which is updated sporadically, so his company could join the 21st century. He tells me it's been a big hit with his customers, even though you still need to order through fax or over the phone. I'm proud to help him out however I can.

## My Role in the Project

Built it, working with my grandfather to tailor it to exactly how he wants it.
