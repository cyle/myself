# PHP Basic Site Template

**July 2013**

## Project Description

I build a lot of PHP sites. In fact, a goddamn whole ton of a lot. I found myself replicating certain patterns every time I started one, so I just canonized it in a simple template that I can clone with git every time I start a new PHP site. It's very simple, and assumes you want to hide some of your controller code, and are using [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/) as your web server layer.

## My Role in the Project

I built it, I use it.

## Technology Used
