# EMRSN/ec1880.us

**Fall 2012**

## Project Description

For the new president of Emerson College's inauguration ceremony I built a URL shortener for Emerson College. The original name was EMRSN, but we couldn't find a good domain name for it, so it was changed to [ec1880.us](http://ec1880.us/). The shortener is still in use by some Journalism activities and the Library, among others. I used this project as a good excuse to use MongoDB in production for the first time.
