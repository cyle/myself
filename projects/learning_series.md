# Interweb Learning Series

**Summer 2011**

## Project Description

A lot of people ask me for help with web development projects, and I've helped teach a lot of people the basics of web development. With that in mind, I wrote a series of longform guides on web development. Some of it is straight teaching things like PHP and HTML, while other guides are overviews of concepts like systems architecture and regular expressions. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback from them. I hosted two hands-on workshops, "Basic Linux Skills" and "Real Web Development", at Emerson College in April 2012, and I might do some more.

I've started developing an online course on Emerson's Learning Management System, Canvas, about "Full Stack Web Development", which is based on the learning series.

## My Role in the Project

I wrote it! I also taught two workshops, and continue to work on a more comprehensive curriculum for an online class.
