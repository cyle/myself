# Open Calls

**Summer 2013**

## Project Description

A coworker and I always wanted a really straightforward website that connected people making projects with people who want to participate in projects. Specifically, film/video projects. It's pretty obvious: an actor wants to get roles in movies, a producer/director needs to find talent and crew. So we've made a website to do that. It'll start at Emerson College and hopefully work outwards from there.

## My Role in the Project

I built it, designed it, etc.

## Technology Used
