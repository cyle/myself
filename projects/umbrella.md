## Project Description

Emerson's Help Desk and Lab Operations departments use a custom-built time and problem tracking system for their lab spaces and student workers. In 2011 it was old and nobody supported it, so I rebuilt it from scratch to be simpler and supportable. Recently, the problem tracking feature has been replaced by an independent third-party ticketing system. It currently features time tracking for student shifts, shift coverage requests, item tracking, lab printer statuses, student availability tracking, and user contact sheets. I'm probably going to rebuild it again to trim it down even further, since some of the functionality may be unnecessary soon.

## My Role in the Project
