# SPACE GAME!

**August 2013 - Present**

## Project Description

Ever since [Cosmic Rift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Rift) got shut down, I've wanted to create a similar game. A basic, top-down, space trading and combat game with Newtonian physics. So I'm trying to build it, with what limited game development knowledge I have. So far, I've tried making it in Processing, Processing.js, Cinder, raw C++, and none of them have been good enough. Now I'm build it with [Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) and it's starting to look good. I'll have more updates as I work on it.

## My Role in the Project

I'm building it.

## Technology Used

- Javascript
- the [Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) library
- Go, for some backend pieces
- PHP, for some backend pieces
- Node.js, for some backend pieces
