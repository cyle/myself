# Writer - Poetry website

**2008**

## Project Description

I wanted to create a place online for people to post and share poetry, especially for my poetry workshop classes I had been taking. I created the site with one major feature in mind: saving and sharing different "drafts" of poems, much like a wiki. I was also inspired by [YTMND](http://ytmnd.com/)'s style of content aggregation.

## My Role in the Project

I built it, and posted a couple poems on it.

## Technology Used

- PHP
- MySQL
