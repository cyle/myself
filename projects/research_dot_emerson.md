# Research Dot Emerson

**Summer 2013**

## Project Description

At Emerson College, the Communication Sciences and Disorders department approached me, asking what would be the easiest way to collect information from potential research study participants. My answer was to find someone to build a simple database interface -- and that developer ended up being me. The tough part was making the entire thing top-to-bottom encrypted so it could securely hold private medical data.
