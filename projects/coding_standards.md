# Coding Standards for Emerson College

**Spring 2014**

## Project Description

The Emerson College Developer's Working Group (myself being its leader) was charged with drafting a document outlining the coding/programming standards for Emerson code work. After a lot of writing, we came up with something we agreed on.

Unfortunately I currently cannot make it public, but since the majority of it is based on my personal coding standards, maybe I'll publish an abridged personal version someday soon.

## My Role in the Project

I drafted it and lead discussions about it.

## Technology Used
