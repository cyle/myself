# CyleNet

**April 2013**

## Project Description

For my birthday, I decided to build myself an internet clone, affectionately called **CyleNet**. It replicates a DNS-like service (called Winners Name Service) and an HTTP-like service (called Cyle's Transfer Protocol). It's completely unfinished, and is nothing more than a couple of node.js scripts at the moment, but it was fun to build for a second. I was thinking about working on it further, but I feel like the NSA might start knocking on my door, as the whole point of CyleNet was to be encrypted end-to-end for completely secure communication.
