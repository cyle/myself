# Cylesoft

**February 2013**

## Project Description

At work, everyone refers to the things I build as "Cylesoft". And when anyone mentions "Cylesoft" as a potential solution to a problem, the problem is usually something impossible to articulate. People say: "well, we'll get some Cylesoft to fix this, because I don't know of any other option."

I'm not saying I enjoy this term, and I'm not using it to brag about my skills, but I find the other-worldly/magical quality that people ascribe to it to be very entertaining. I wanted to make a site that reflected the general sentiment people seem to have for my work.

Originally I wanted to make a very mid-90s corporate website with shitty 16-bit GIFs, but that didn't satisfy. It needed to be weirder, simpler, so I came up with the poorly animated javascript starfield.

## My Role in the Project

I built it, I live it.

## Technology Used

- good old hand-written HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Google web fonts
