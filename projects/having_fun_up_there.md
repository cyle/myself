# Having Fun Up There

**Fall 2013**

## Project Description

Another feature-length film! *Having Fun Up There* is the story of a 30-something failed musician who's trying to figure out what to do with his life. It's what every artist struggles with -- do I sacrifice my life to be an artist, or do I get a job and play gigs on nights and weekends?

For this we shot it in RAW on a Canon 5D Mk3 running the [Magic Lantern](http://magiclantern.fm/) firmware. I wrote a lot about it in the link below.
