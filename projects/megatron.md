# Identity Management - Codenamed "MEGATRON"

**2011 - Present**

## Project Description

Wrangling an Identity Management solution for Emerson College has been an ongoing process over the last couple of years, but it's finally coming together. I've codenamed the project "MEGATRON" internally. I built my own custom single sign on system based on the original prototypes.

## My Role in the Project

I'm project lead and custom plugin developer, probably going to be systems integrator as well.

## Technology Used

	- PHP
	- SAML
	- Ellucian Banner
