# Wordpress at Emerson

**Phase 1: 2010**

**Phase 2: 2011**

**Phase 3: 2013**

## Project Description

I built a Wordpress MU server for Emerson College so classes could have their own blogs without needing to rely on outside vendors like wordpress.com or blogger or whatever. That was phase 1. The project expanded very quickly, and I had to host a second Wordpress MU instance on the same server for departmental/staff use, which was phase 2. Eventually, I had to move that second Wordpress instance off to its own server. Phase 3, happening now, is to expand further with a third server for miscellaneous/student organization blogs.

## My Role in the Project

Built the servers, I still maintain and administrate them, scaling them out when needed.

## Technology Used
