# cylebot

**Summer 2007 - Present, ongoing**

## Project Description

Cylebot is an IRC bot used in Emerson IT's student-staff chatroom. Originally, cylebot was simply an mIRC client with a lot of custom scripted autoresponders, and people wouldn't know whether it was me or the "bot" talking to them. Eventually, this got too boring for me, so I used my newly-learned node.js skills to craft an independent cylebot with greatly expanded capacity.

Since then, cylebot now has a long list of commands, ranging from random song suggestions (from my iTunes library), composing poetry, to randomly asking about things people have been talking about in chat. The idea of cylebot has also expanded to be more of an art project for me, as I see the pieces of him I've programmed be strange automated reflections of my own mannerisms and personality.

Over the years, cylebot's inner functionality was largely secret. However, I've decided to open source him, in an effort to encourage other people to explore his capacities.

## My Role in the Project

I made him, I feed him, I continue developing new features.
