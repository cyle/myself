# Emerson IT Online Presence

**Fall 2012 - Present, ongoing**

## Project Description

I took it upon myself to update Emerson College's online presence. In collaboration with all departments of IT, I've rebuilt our website and rethought how it's organized. The approach I chose was twofold: obviousness and responsiveness. The goal of the site is to have help, guides, policies, etc, be as obviously accessible as possible, and to have the interface of the site itself be responsive to the user. With that in mind, I rebuilt the Emerson website "skin" to be responsive, with the help of the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework. The website also includes a consolidation of our IT blogs, my Nagios API, our public Basecamp projects, and more. I built the backend CMS from scratch -- it's extremely simple and straightforward.

The project has launched, and has been a smashing success.
