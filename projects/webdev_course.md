# Full Stack Web Development online course

**January 2013 - Present**

## Project Description

Building off of my [learning series](learning_series.md), I'm adapting the guides into one long curriculum for learning web development. It's still in very early stages as I pull together all of the text into one course, and revise things as necessary. I'd like to make the course open to anyone at Emerson, with no concrete grading, as an unofficial course for the college. I'm using Emerson's Learning Management System, Canvas, for the task.
