# Sexually Frank - Feature Film

**Summer 2010**

## Project Description

My good friend and coworker Frankie Frain is a filmmaker and began working on a new movie (he had made two previous to this) in the winter of 2009. As a joke, I said I could be its director of photography, even though I had never filmed anything in my life and had no idea how to make movies. I ended up being one of the two cinematographers on the film, also credited as a producer, and I had a blast doing it.

The movie has been screened at a few festivals, including NYC's CineKink in 2012, the Syndey International Underground Film Festival, and a couple more that I can't even remember. This project lead to us making [Vibes](vibes.md), a short film, and we're going to be making another feature this year (2013).
