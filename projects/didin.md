# DIDIN

**Summer 2011**

## Project Description

I keep building little web apps that help my productivity. This one, DIDIN (which stands for "DO IT, [DO IT NOW!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6ALySsPXt0)"), is a very simple to-do list. Inspired by to do list apps like [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/), which was in beta at the time, it features tagging, time-priority, inline editing, and other neat Web 2.0 features. I've long since abandoned using it, but it was a neat exercise.
