# Median

**2007 - Present**

## Project Description

Commonly referred to as "Emerson's YouTube", Median is a custom built content uploading and delivery platform for use by Emerson College faculty, staff, and students. Anyone with an Emerson account can upload videos, audio, images, documents, or post links, and then associate them with classes, departments, categories, playlists, groups, whatever. The site is used commonly by student organizations, film festivals, core curriculums, and the main Emerson website.

Median versions 1.0 through 3.0 were built with the help of John Richardson. Median 3.5 and onward were built solely by me. The evolution of Median has been the main playing ground for me as a developer, and almost all of my major progress as a web developer can be traced through Median's development. My first attempts at systems architecture were through the expression of Median's infrastructure and transcoding farm (which I have recently made open source).

Most recently, Median 5 utilizes the Foundation framework, a lot of jQuery, a lot of PHP, and has moved from Microsoft SQL to MongoDB as the primary database layer. Median has a public API that has been used by several applications across the college. Median's front-end interface was originally 100% Flash- and Flex-based, but is now HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## My Role in the Project

I built it, administer it, support it, and continue to iterate new versions based on the shifting demands of faculty, staff, and students.
