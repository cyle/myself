# PHP Secure Login System

**July 2013**

## Project Description

I keep building PHP sites that need good login systems, so I just built a template project that is a demo of a secure login system using bcrypt (having been the most recommended way to hash passwords in contemporary applications). It also features session storage, to minimize the amount of times the user has to input their password. It treats those sessions as password-equivalent, so they're also hashed in the database the same way a password would be.

## My Role in the Project

I built the damn thing!

## Technology Used

- PHP
- MySQL
- new PHP crypt() functionality with bcrypt algorithms
