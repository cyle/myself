# The Newer New Media Server

**2009, I think**

## Project Description

The New Media department at Emerson College has a server dedicated to being a sandbox for students to learn web development. When I joined the program, it was pretty neat, but it was getting old and unreliable. I took it upon myself to build a new one from scratch, using the latest versions of PHP, Python, Ruby, MySQL, and more. It's a bit out of date now -- I need to rebuild it again -- but it's still used by students in the Interactive Media (the new New Media) program. It auto-provisions new users with file space and database access, so I never have to touch it.

## My Role in the Project

I built it, and continue to maintain and support it.
