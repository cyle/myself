# Venture Capitalism

**2008 - Present, ongoing**

## Project Description

I tried to minor in poetry in college, but I was one class short. Nevertheless, I keep writing poetry very occasionally, and trim them to small collections which I've labelled "venture capitalism" parts 1 through 3. Not sure if I ever want to do more with them.

## My Role in the Project

I wrote them.

## Technology Used

- good old HTML
- Google Web Fonts (for VC3)
