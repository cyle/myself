# Casual Dungeons & Dragons with Cyle and Molly

**January 2013 - Present**

## Project Description

I've always wanted to try playing D&D, but it's dense with rules and whatnot. In an effort to make it easier to play, I wrote a long (but simpler) guide to making a D&D character, as well as provide some tools for Dungeon Masters.

## My Role in the Project

I wrote it, based on the D&D 4e books.

## Technology Used

	- good old HTML
	- Javascript
	- Google Web Fonts
