# Lab Statistics and Information Division

**2009, I think**

## Project Description

I built this page to pull information from Emerson's real-time [Labstats](http://www.computerlabsolutions.com/labstats.cfm) information database and present it in a much more friendly and useful format. It displays, in real time, the current usage of computer lab spaces around the Emerson campus. I also include class lab usage information, which is pulled from a custom course master database.

## My Role in the Project

I designed it and built it, and I still maintain it.

## Technology Used

	- PHP
	- Microsoft SQL
	- custom data mining
