# The Lunch Tool

**Summer 2012**

## Project Description

Every summer in Emerson IT, we like to eat outside. However, we don't always agree on that. To stop some of the fighting and organize things better, I made a quick and dirty tool that allows us to anonymously vote on whether or not we want to eat outside. It reminds everyone to vote at 11am, and then notifies everyone of the result at 11:45am, right before we all leave our offices for lunch.

It might just be one of the nerdiest things I've ever built. It's inactive during the colder months, since we'll always be eating inside.
