# After-Life 2

**2009**

## Project Description

For my BFA degree, I chose to work with my roommate Galen Ellis on a video game. Put simply, the game builds a nonlinear narrative in which the player observes the breakdown of the game universe. An art game, it's meant to confuse, and to lay bare the inner workings of the game engine itself. As a mod of the game Half-Life 2, it received [mixed reviews](http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/after-life-2-half-life-2-ep2/), but was praised by Emerson faculty as a new media project.

The project was presented at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts alongside other Emerson BFA projects.

## My Role in the Project
