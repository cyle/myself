# 4chan Image Scrubber

**Winter 2009**

## Project Description

The 4chan Image Scrubber was a Processing project I made for class. It simply loaded 4chan's /b/ board, ran some regular expressions to capture image URLs, and then presented them one at a time at random in the program's window. The project was picked up by Emerson curator-in-residence Joe Ketner's contemporary art class and shown for several months in one of Emerson's galleries with other student works.
