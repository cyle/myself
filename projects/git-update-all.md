# git-update-all CLI tool

**July 2013**

## Project Description

I started using [Crunchbang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/) on one of my work computers (it's amazing), but I didn't have a useful Linux alternative to my favorite git repo GUI [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). I settled on [git-cola](http://git-cola.github.io/), but it lacked a robust way to check up on many git repositories, specifically fetching info from remotes. So I wrote up a simple ruby script that reads every git repo within a certain folder, fetches the remote updates, and lets the user know what repos are ahead, behind, or clean.
