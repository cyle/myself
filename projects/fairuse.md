# Fair Use at Emerson College

**Summer/Fall 2012**

## Project Description

Emerson College IT, ITG, Media Services, and the Library got together to think of ways to better represent the struggle of Fair Use (see: use of copyright works in educational institutions) to Emerson faculty. The result was this site, which has information alongside a "Fair Use Utility" designed to help anyone go through a proper Fair Use analysis.

The project is going to be presented at NERCOMP in Providence, RI in 2013.

## My Role in the Project
