# Emerson College Policy Management Team

**Fall 2013 - Spring 2014**

## Project Description

Colleges usually have a hard time writing down their many policies that accumulate over the years. After some serious restructuring within my IT department, I took on the task of coordinating the review and drafting of IT policies.

Working with a great group of people across the department, and our college's legal team, we managed to put together nineteen new policies. We're still working on even more.

## My Role in the Project

Team leader, drafter of a handful of policies.

## Technology Used

- English
