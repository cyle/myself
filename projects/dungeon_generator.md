# D&D Dungeon Generator

**September 2012**

## Project Description

Wizards of the Coast came out with the "D&D Next Playtest", and I wanted to gather some friends together to play it. However, nobody really wanted to play it, so I only got two other people interested. Three people isn't enough to play, because somebody needs to be the Dungeon Master. With that in mind, I created an automated tool to act as the DM, and provide basic adventures through dungeon crawls.

It never actually got used, but it was a worthy exercise just to see if I could do it.
