# Social Disobedience

**Summer 2012 - Present, ongoing**

## Project Description

I wrote a lot of stuff for my [fuck advocacy blog](fuck_advocacy.md), but I wanted to do something much more comprehensive, so I started working on a proper book. The book is about the new generation of "digital natives", and how our culture is distorted and context-less, and what that means for society, art, the future, etc. I ask a lot of questions and I have a lot of opinions, based on my own experiences, reading a lot in college and beyond, and working with the web for my entire life.

I'm not sure if I'm going to seek actual big time publication or just release it quietly on my own terms, self-published. I created a "Bookmaker" script to transform the HTML version of the book into a PDF for publication.

## My Role in the Project

I'm writing it and editing it, and I have help from friends who are reading the initial drafts.

## Technology Used

- good old HTML
- writing words
- Ruby (to help make the actual book format)
